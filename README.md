Tabbycat is a draw tabulation system for 3 vs 3 debating tournaments. It was used at Australs in Auckland 2010, [Wellington 2012](https://www.facebook.com/Australs2012), [Dunedin 2014](http://australs2014.herokuapp.com), [Daejeon 2015](http://australs2015.herokuapp.com) and [Perth 2016](http://australs2016.herokuapp.com), as well as [many other tournaments of all sizes](http://tabbycat.readthedocs.io/en/stable/about/tournament-history.html). To see an example of a post-tournament website, have a look at the [WAustrals 2016 tab website](http://australs2016.herokuapp.com).

**Want to try it out?** The best way to trial Tabbycat is just to launch a new site, as described [in our user guide](https://tabbycat.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install/heroku.html) (or [below](#installation-and-user-guide)). It takes just a few clicks, costs nothing, requires no technical background, and you can always deploy a fresh copy when you're ready to run your tournament.

## Features

- Enter data from multiple computers simultaneously and (optionally) display results, draws, and other information online
- Deployable to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) for an easy, fast, and free setup
- Automated adjudicator allocations based on adjudicator ranking, room importance, and conflicts/clashes
- A drag and drop interface for adjudicator allocation that displays conflicts alongside gender and regional balance
- A fully responsive interface that adapts to suit large screens, laptops, tablets, and phones
- Support for Australs, NZ Easters, Australian Easters, Joynt Scroll, UADC, and WSDC rule sets as well as configurable [draw generation rules](http://tabbycat.readthedocs.io/en/stable/features/draw-generation.html) and [team standings rules](http://tabbycat.readthedocs.io/en/stable/features/team-standings-rules.html)
- Configurable [adjudicator feedback questions](http://tabbycat.readthedocs.io/en/stable/features/adjudicator-feedback.html) with (optional) online submission

## Installation and User Guide

Our user guide is at [tabbycat.readthedocs.io](http://tabbycat.readthedocs.io/). The fastest way to launch a Tabbycat site is to click this button:

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/czlee/tabbycat/tree/master)

During the installation process Heroku will ask you to verify your account by adding a credit or debit card. A standard Tabbycat site *will not charge* your card without explicit permission — charges only accrue if you deliberately add a paid service in the Heroku dashboard.

That said if you do not have access to a credit or debit card we offer a version of the software — 'Tabbykitten' — that does not require Heroku to verify your account. However, as a result, this version is limited: it does not send error reports to the developers and can handle much less public traffic. We strongly recommend using it only as a last resort, and even then only for small tournaments. [Use this link to setup a Tabbykitten version](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/czlee/tabbycat/tree/kitten&env[KITTEN]=true).

## Licence

We haven't released Tabbycat under an open-source licence, so there is no formal and general right to use this software. Nonetheless, you're welcome to freely use Tabbycat to help run a debating tournament. However, if your tournament is run as a for-profit or for-fundraising activity a donation to Tabbycat's maintainers is required. More details [are available in our license information](http://tabbycat.readthedocs.io/en/latest/about/licence.html).
