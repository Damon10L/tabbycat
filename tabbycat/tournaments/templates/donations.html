    Tabbycat is a volunteer effort. Since 2012, its maintainers have spent
    thousands of hours working on it.
  </li>
  <li class="list-group-item">
    Donating to Tabbycat helps the maintainers to meet recurring costs and
    justify our ongoing contributions in responding to support enquiries,
    keeping the software up to date, fixing bugs, and developing new features.
  </li>
  <li class="list-group-item">
    We suggest that tournaments budget for a donation of A$1 (Australian dollar)
     per team. For tournaments run for fundraising or for profit, whether partly
     or solely, this payment is <strong>required</strong> and your licence to
    use Tabbycat is conditional upon it. General donations from individuals or
    organisations are of course also much appreciated.

      Our suggested donation from {{ tournament }}, based on its size, is
      <strong>A${{ tournament.billable_teams }}</strong>. The easiest way to donate is
      <a href="http://PayPal.Me/tabbycatproject/{{ tournament.billable_teams }}aud">via Paypal</a>, but please donâ€™t
      hesitate to contact us if other methods would work better for you.
